# Delightful To-Do App

This repository hosts a simple, client-side to-do application that runs in the browser. Tasks are stored in your browser's `localStorage` so they persist across refreshes.

## Run locally

Use a static file server to view the app. Python's built-in server works well:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

Then open <http://localhost:8000> in your browser.
